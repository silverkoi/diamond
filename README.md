# Implementation of Diamond Standard

This is an implementation of the [EIP-2535 Diamond
Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2535) that uses
[ERC-7201 Namespaced Storage Layout](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7201).

In particular, this means this diamond implementation is compatible with
OpenZeppelin's V5 contracts.
